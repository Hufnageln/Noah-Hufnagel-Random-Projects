Comments: Overall This was a very enjoyable lab. Most of the problems I 
encountered involved array and register management.

Bonus B is incorporated into search.s I had an aha moment for it when I realized i could just detect when
we hit a NULL instead of using index and size.

Bonus A is written in lab6bonus.s. there is a seperate make command for it
called make lab6bonus and the executable for this file after runnign this
make command is called lab6bonus
