Comments: Overall This was a very interesting project. I was pleasantly surprised by my ability
to figure out terse insert and deleteSome relatively simply. I struggled a decenet amount with
wrapping my head around file input, but i got it eventually. after I figured out iterate the
rest of the list functions were pretty simple. Unreliable allocation didnt give me much trouble
